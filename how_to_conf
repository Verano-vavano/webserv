DEFINE SPACE_MODE must be declared on the first line of the file and written in a strict manner (no extra space between DEFINE and SPACE_MODE)

An existing server or location might be fully overwritten if same port / same uri

Errors by default are ignored (except if DEFINE ERROR_STOP toggled). Fatal errors can occure in case of fatal mistakes in the config file

Comments must be on new command and last until a separator is found
'http #start of HTTP block {' <- invalid
'http { #start of HTTP block server { ...' <- invalid (not separated)
'http { #start of HTTP block; server { ...' <- valid


'server 8080 { ... }' == 'server { listen 8080; ... }'

For boolean methods (absolute_redirect for example), not specifying an argument will toggle it on.
To toggle it off, an 'off' argument must be specified.
Hence "absolute_redirect;" == "absolute_redirect on;"
To make so not specifying an argument toggles on and off, please specify the define TOGGLE_BOOL.


CGIs:
- cgi-exec will mark the following files as executables. Thus if the extension is not in the cgi-interpreter list, it will try to be executed as is.
- cgi-interpreter will associate a file extension with an interpreter
